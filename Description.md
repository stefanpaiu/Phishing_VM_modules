# Phishing VM

This repository contains Puppet modules to setup computer security challanges inside
a virtual machine. The project as a whole acts like a simulation of how a user, called
'Hacker' would be given an virtual environment and will try to find security breaches
and exploit them. 

**The project as a whole is intended to show the possible vulnerabilities created by 
Phishing and test users' skills learned from the Documentation.

These Puppet modules contain security vulnerabilities and are not intended for live
machines.**
